# Question-Answering-Forum

https://apps.nms.kcl.ac.uk/stf/teams/19/student_github

Assignment

The Lab Project is 6-week development project where you develop a small system during weekly 2-hour labs and use the time between labs for training and learning new technologies so that you are equipped to meet the project's technical challenges. This page is the assignment you are required to complete in this project. For more information on the practical organisation and the assessment criteria for the Lab Project, please review the module handbook pages on the Lab Project.

Task

In the Lab Project, you are required to:

Develop a prototype web application that provides question-answering forum. All development work should take place within the weekly 2-hour project lab that you have been allocated to, but you may take on additional training in between lab sessions, as agreed with your team.
Maintain a shared repository of your code using KCL GitHub Enterprise. The repository must be linked to your team's records on Team Feedback.
Have a 10-15 minute coordination meeting with your team at the end of your development session in which you agree any training to be undertaken in between the labs. One member of your team must take minutes of those meetings using Team Feedback.
Deploy this web application in a free Heroku container.
Project Brief

This project requires you to develop a web-based question answering forum. The application is aimed at King's College London students who have questions about their course and can be answered by anyone, students and staff alike. Because your team's development time is very limited, only a prototype implementation is required. The user interface of this application is not important, but must be functional. Your application must provide a means to post a question, to read questions and answers to questions and to post an answer to an existing question. Your application should have a means to identify the author of a question or answer, and, ideally, the identity of a user is verified. If and only if you are able to implement all of the above, you may add additional features, such as those inspired by popular question-answer sites like Stack Overflow.

Deliverables

At the end of the project, you must submit a single tar.gz or zip file that has the name of your team and contains a directory with the following:

A README.md that contains a link to URL where the web application is deployed by Heroku. The file should also state the name of your team and the members of your team. If you have reused any code or used any APIs, these must be listed here and attributed, along with a short description as to what functionality that code/API provides.
All your source code and tests.
A PDF document of no more than 4 sides of A4 that describes the design of your application. The design document must be accurate and easy to read/understand by someone who is not familiar with your team's work, but it does not have to be complete. The design document must be named design.pdf
Following the project, your team is required to retain the KCL GitHub repository, the Team Feedback records and the Heroku container with the deployed web application until at least 1 October 2018, so that your work can be scrutinised and audited for marking.

Getting started with developing web applications

Developing web applications is not dissimilar to developing any other type of software. You already know how to code and you have good foundation in database systems. That is more than enough to get started. There is one complication though. Web application run on a web server, so you need a web server for development. Given the short time available for this project, I strong recommend you do not set up your own development web server unless you have a lot of experience with this. Additional advice will be provided.
