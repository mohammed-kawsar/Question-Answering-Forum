# Awkward Stack

Our project is to create a forum for students to ask questions so they can get answers from other students or teachers.
We aim to included many of the functionalities that can be find in Stack Overflow.
Users can sign up, and then ask question, all logged in users are able to comment any question.

##Team name:
*Dandelion*



A README.md that contains a link to URL where the web application is deployed by Heroku. The file should also state the name of your team and the members of your team. If you have reused any code or used any APIs, these must be listed here and attributed, along with a short description as to what functionality that code/API provides. Update 5/12/2017: Although all required deliverables are specified in this document, if there is any additional information you wish to provide with your submission, this should be included here. If the additional information is substantial, you may create a Wiki in your GitHub repository, but you should specify that in README.md.
